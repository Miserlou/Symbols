Symbols is an interactive numerical and symbolic computational environment for Android. In fairness, it must also be noted that this is, I assume, terminologically a "fork" of the Jasymca for Android project. Using Jasmyca as its backbone, it provides a fair bit of the current implementations of Octave, Maxima, and Matlab mathematical functions. It also extends Jasymca in that some extended computational sets have been included. Of course, there is more to come.
